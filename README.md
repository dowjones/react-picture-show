# React Picture Show [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/dowjones/react-picture-show.png)](http://travis-ci.org/dowjones/react-picture-show) [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-picture-show.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/react-picture-show)

A Bare bones slideshow component that handles transitions between slides and exposes control so that it is easy to decorate with other controls. Out of the box, it supports **swiping to paginate, clicking left and right, and lasyloading slides**

### How slides work

Slides are the direct child components of a ``<PictureShow/>``. They are cloned with the following additional properties:

```jsx
{
  slideRatio: Number, // the ratio of the outer slide (w/h)
  slidePending: Boolean // whether the slide can be lazyloaded
}
```
By cloning the children with these props, you are free to create 'slide' components that react to them however you want. If the child already has one of these props it will be replaced (even for ```<img/>``` components)

_Note: If ```suppressPending``` property is true on ```<PictureShow/>```, then the slide will not render, so you will not need to handle the ```pending``` prop at the slide level. ```suppressPending``` exists for edge cases where the user wants to define how 'not loading' works_

## Properties in Depth

#### ratio

Defines the shape of the slideshow as a fixed ratio so that it can flex inside its parent container.
